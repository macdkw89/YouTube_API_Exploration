UC06E4Y_-ybJgBUMtXx8uNNw,TheBackyardScientist,"Aloha YouTubers, I am The Backyard Scientist!

I like to make videos on all the crazy stuff I do. From exploding arrows, to making instruments, molten aluminum to science/chemistry experiments - I do it so you don't have to! I'm always thinking of more stuff to do, if you have an idea, id love to hear it!

Almost everything I do can be considered dangerous!!  If you insist on trying my videos at home, just remember- if you play with fire, you're going to get burned. Electricity is deadly. Be safe guys :)

I love email from subscribers!

You are free to share / upload my videos on social media (FB,Instagram,Twitter,etc...) 
Only if:
- you do not run ads on the video or page it's played on (No websites or YT uploads) Reactions, using clips in YT videos is OK as long as it doesn't violate the spirit of FAIR USE.
- you credit my YouTube channel AND tag the corresponding social media site.
- you may not sell my videos or edits of videos under any circumstance. 

Anything else, email me.",@thebackyardscientist,2013-04-01 16:41:52+00:00,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-pMhLCPGuSocGvSsmphnEKhzu83lYHyQx9FhbRPw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,,734126790,5410000,175,"['/m/019_rr', '/m/01k8wb', '/m/03glg']","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby']",UU06E4Y_-ybJgBUMtXx8uNNw,top_science_channels
