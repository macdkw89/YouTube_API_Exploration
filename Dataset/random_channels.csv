UCS-SLEeQ1F7k7mpmhnKVMKw,Cooking On The Farm,"   Hi my name is Rachel. My husband David and I have many different hobbies, God, family, farm work, cooking and filming. We decided to put some if our interests to work. David took film in high school and collage. I have always cooked. I can remember being on the counter as a 3 year old helping my mom cook and bake. In high school I started developing my own recipes. Now that we have kids and time is so busy I have been adapting my meals to be freezer friendly and learning to can. 
   In my videos you can expect to learn all about cooking how to make things from scratch and short cuts for busy nights. As a family we are always striving to serve other people in the ways God wants us. We want this channel to be family friendly. helping families join together around the table for a beautiful meal. We pray your days are full of grace and God peace.

It only took us about 5 years and about a billion people asking ""did you film it?!"" to figure out, hmmm... let's start a Travel Channel!

So, here we are! As a travel couple we've managed to squeeze all our belongings in 1 shared suitcase and 2 backpacks. We survive off of flight miles, Airbnb's, lots off coffee and donuts. Our absolute favorite thing on earth is to hear when we've inspired someone else to live a life by design and pack up to travel in their own way. Follow us as we check off a never ending bucket-list around the world!

Stop by and say ""hi!"", find us on a corner of the internet and let us know where you're from and what's your favorite travel destination!
